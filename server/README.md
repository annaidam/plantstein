# Server

This folder contains the code and documentation for the server and database.
For now, the server uses a in-memory H2 database.

# Run this project

To run this project, make sure to enable Annotation Processing if you're using IntelliJ (just press Shift two times and

Otherwise, IntelliJ won't recognize the Java project (automatically).
