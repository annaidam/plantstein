# Microcontroller

This folder contains the code and documentation for the microcontroller.

## Setup

Install the following packages:

```
Seeed Arduino rpcWifi
Seeed Arduino rpcUnified
PubSubClient
Grove Temperature and Humidity
Seeed Arduino FS
Seeed Arduino SFUD
Seeed_Arduino_mbedt
ArduinoJson
```

- Copy .exmaple.WiFi.h to WiFi.h and edit it accordingly.
- If you're testing at home and have both a 2.4ghz and 5ghz wifi, make sure both your device (with the mqtt broker) and the microcontroller are connected to the 2.4ghz wifi.
